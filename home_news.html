            The Alienware m16 R2 is a compact yet powerful gaming laptop from Dell. It features an impressive design, strong performance, and a variety of modes to suit different needs. In this m16 R2 review we find that it balances work and play efficiently. Whenever you think of Alienware — a brand by Dell — it is natural to imagine a bulky, performance-driven machine that is built specifically for gamers. However, the Alienware m16 R2 breaks away from this. The laptop, with a compact design, will fool you into believing that it is a laptop built for work and office. Like a wolf in a sheep’s skin. You’ll only realise it's also a gaming laptop when you spot the RGB-lit Alienware logo.

            In recent years, the traditionally male-dominated fields of science and engineering have seen a notable change. With more and more women finding success as engineers, astrophysicists, and inventors, the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields have seen a significant leap when it comes to inclusion and gender equality. However, this progress has been slow and fraught with challenges rooted in social norms, stereotypes and institutional barriers, with many women reporting the difficulties they have faced in getting the same educational and professional opportunities as their male counterparts.

            It was a two-storey brick house in Princeton, Texas, that no one seemed to notice among the other newly constructed buildings. The house is now at the centre of a massive probe by Princeton police, the scale of which it hadn't dealt with earlier. It was, according to police, the nest of programming slaves run by four Indians.
            The four Indians, including three Telugus, have been arrested but are out on bail. Fifteen women have been rescued. Police say the number of victims could well be around 50. They are expecting to make more arrests too.
